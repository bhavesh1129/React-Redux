# React Redux Learning Project

This project is designed to help students learn and understand the core concepts of React Redux and React Router through a practical, hands-on example. It implements a simple authentication flow to demonstrate state management and routing concepts in a real-world scenario.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understanding Redux state management with Redux Toolkit
- Implementing protected routes with React Router
- Managing authentication state in a React application
- Working with layouts and nested routes

## 🚀 Key Technologies

- React 18
- Redux Toolkit (for state management)
- React Router v6 (for routing)
- Vite (for build tooling)

## 📦 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```

## 💡 Key Features

- **Authentication Flow**: Demonstrates Redux state management for user authentication
- **Protected Routes**: Shows how to protect routes based on authentication status
- **Shared Layouts**: Implements common layouts using nested routes
- **Redux Toolkit Integration**: Uses modern Redux patterns with Redux Toolkit

## 📚 Learning Points

- How Redux manages global state in a React application
- Using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` for simplified Redux logic
- Implementing protected routes with React Router
- Managing layouts with nested routes
- Using Redux selectors to access state
